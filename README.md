The code [Tased when damaged in game.py](https://github.com/samuelcool5/Programmering-1/blob/main/Tased%20when%20damaged%20in%20game.py) detects if damage has been taken in a game by reading the numbers of the health 0-100 then tases you if it goes down.

Check [Text detection.py](https://github.com/samuelcool5/Programmering-1/blob/main/Text%20detection.py) for history to a certain point then go to [Tased when damaged in game.py](https://github.com/samuelcool5/Programmering-1/blob/main/Tased%20when%20damaged%20in%20game.py) for the rest of the history and the finnished code.
